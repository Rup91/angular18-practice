## Control flow

Structural directives are directives which change the DOM layout by adding and removing DOM elements.

Angular provides a set of built-in structural directives (such as NgIf, NgForOf, NgSwitch and others) which are commonly used in all Angular projects.

So far we were using these structural directives like - *ngIf, *ngFor, *ngSwitch 

But from Angular 17, team angular is suggesting us to use new Control flow syntaxes - @for, @if, @ff.. @else, @switch etc
